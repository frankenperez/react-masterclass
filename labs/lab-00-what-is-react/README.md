## What is React

**React** is a modern open-source web development toolkit built by Facebook. Is a declarative, efficient, and flexible **JavaScript library**, one of the most popular in the market, for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces and specifically for developing single page applications.

React lets you compose complex User Interfaces from small and isolated parts called **components** which merged together to complete a view. Dividing web applications up into components is a central idea to creating applications with React. Instead of a gigantic monolith of a web page, you will generally consider the individual pieces that make up an application and divide it up into smaller pieces that are much easier to develop, debug, and to generally think about.
